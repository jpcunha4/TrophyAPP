# TrophyApp

This app is made to consume the [Trophy API](https://github.com/jpcunha4/TrophyAPI). The main idea is to get basic info of players from a game and present them in a table. Each category has 5 Trophies, but each monster have their own Thropy. The Trophy rank is shown bellow:

- Coins

  1. 1 coin
  2. 100 coins
  3. 1000 coins
  4. 10000 coins
  5. 100000 coins

- Deaths

  1. 1 death
  2. 10 deaths
  3. 25 deaths
  4. 50 deaths
  5. 100 deaths

- Dead monsters (Turtles / Bowsers)
  1. 1 Monster
  2. 100 Monsters
  3. 1000 Monsters
  4. 10000 Monsters
  5. 100000 Monsters
